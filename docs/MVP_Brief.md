# Ulearn MVP Brief

**Peer-to-Peer Academic Support Network**  
**Version:** 1.0 | **Date:** September 2026  
**Status:** Ready for development

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This brief defines the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for Ulearn. It captures:

- What we will build first
- Why these features were chosen
- What is deliberately left out
- How the product will expand after the pilot

The goal is to ship a focused, trustworthy version that proves the core idea with real students, while leaving a clear path for growth that can be shown in pitch materials.

## 2. Problem Recap

Many university students fall behind in core course units but hesitate to ask lecturers for help. Large classes, fear of judgment, and limited access to personalised support turn small misunderstandings into retakes and academic drop-off.

Existing options (large review sessions, generic study groups, or pure self-study) often fail to address **hyper-specific** learning gaps quickly and without stigma.

Ulearn solves this by matching a struggling student with a verified peer who has already succeeded in that exact area.

---

## 3. MVP Goal

**Enable a student to request help on a specific topic, get matched with a suitable peer tutor, complete a short session, and rate the tutor — so the system can build trust and verification over time.**

If this loop works reliably in a small pilot, the foundation for a scalable academic safety net is proven.

---

## 4. Core User Flows

### Tutee

1. Creates an account and basic profile
2. Submits a help request (course unit + specific topic)
3. Sees a short list of eligible tutors
4. Requests a session with one tutor
5. Completes the session
6. Rates the tutor

### Tutor

1. Creates an account and declares course units + grades
2. Starts as **Provisional Tutor** (if grade threshold is met)
3. Receives and accepts/declines match requests
4. Completes sessions
5. Earns ratings that can promote them to **Verified Tutor**

### System

- Filters tutors by competency and status
- Ranks eligible tutors simply
- Logs sessions
- Updates tutor verification status based on ratings

## 5. MVP Feature Scope

### 5.1 Included (Must Have)

| Area                      | Features                                                                                                                                                                                     | Rationale                                                          |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Accounts & Roles**      | Sign up / login, basic profile (name, faculty, year), roles: Tutee, Provisional Tutor, Verified Tutor                                                                                        | Identity and trust require clear roles from day one                |
| **Tutor Validation**      | Self-declared course units + minimum grade (B+ / A), Provisional status on entry, filtering by competency + status                                                                           | Protects academic quality without heavy institutional integration  |
| **Matching**              | Help request (unit + topic), list of 1–3 eligible tutors, request → accept/decline flow, simple ranking (Verified > Provisional, then rating)                                                | Delivers the core value proposition                                |
| **Sessions**              | Session record on acceptance, mark as completed, basic time/note field                                                                                                                       | Creates the data needed for ratings and future incentives          |
| **Rating & Verification** | Mandatory 1–5 rating + optional short feedback after session, running average, automatic promotion (Provisional → Verified after threshold), reduced priority for low ratings, visible badge | Closes the quality loop and makes verification earned, not claimed |
| **Light Admin**           | Ability to view users/requests/sessions and manually adjust status if needed                                                                                                                 | Safety net during pilot                                            |

### 5.2 Explicitly Out of Scope for MVP

| Feature                         | Reason for Exclusion                                                              |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| University SSO / transcript API | High integration cost; self-declaration is sufficient for pilot                   |
| In-app chat or video            | Students already use WhatsApp/Zoom; adds complexity without proving the core loop |
| Payments / financial incentives | Incentive model starts with certificates and leadership credits                   |
| Certificate PDF generation      | Can be manual or added immediately after pilot                                    |
| Advanced AI matching            | Simple rule-based matching is clearer and more trustworthy at launch              |
| Push notifications              | Email or in-app notices are enough initially                                      |
| Multi-university / multi-campus | Focus on one institution first                                                    |
| Full analytics dashboard        | Basic logs are sufficient for early learning                                      |

## 6. Key Design Decisions

**1. Self-declared grades + community ratings (instead of instant transcript verification)**  
Institutional data access takes time. Self-declaration with a hard grade gate, combined with mandatory ratings, gives us speed and quality control for the pilot.

**2. Provisional → Verified promotion path**  
New tutors are not hidden, but they are clearly labelled. Consistent positive ratings unlock the Verified badge. This creates a fair, transparent reputation system.

**3. Student chooses from a short list (instead of pure auto-match)**  
Giving the tutee final choice increases trust and reduces the feeling of being “assigned” a stranger.

**4. No in-app communication tools in MVP**  
The product’s job is matching and quality control. Communication can stay on channels students already trust.

**5. Keep the first pilot narrow**  
One (or few) high-need course units, 10–20 tutors, and the students in those units. Depth before breadth.

---

## 7. Success Criteria for the MVP

The MVP will be considered successful when:

- A student can request help and receive a suitable match
- A session can be completed and rated
- Tutors can move from Provisional to Verified based on real feedback
- A small pilot can run without breaking trust or creating quality complaints
- We collect enough usage data to refine matching and incentives

Target pilot size: one priority course unit, 10–20 active tutors, and measurable session completion + rating rates.

## 8. Future Expansion (Beyond MVP)

This roadmap is designed to appear in pitch slides as the natural evolution of the product.

### Phase 2 – Trust & Convenience

- Official transcript / portal verification (harder gate)
- Optional portfolio links (e.g. GitHub for computing modules)
- In-app messaging or scheduled session reminders
- Automatic Teaching Assistant certificate generation
- Leadership credit export for university recognition

### Phase 3 – Scale & Institutional Integration

- University SSO
- Faculty and programme-level dashboards
- Multi-course and multi-faculty rollout
- Availability calendars and smarter matching
- Basic analytics for administrators (retake risk signals, popular topics, tutor performance)

### Phase 4 – Sustainability & Partnerships

- Corporate or institutional sponsorship of tutoring hours
- Formal partnership with academic departments
- Cross-university expansion
- Deeper LMS / LTI integration where valuable

Each phase builds directly on the proven MVP loop rather than replacing it.

## 9. Recommended Build Sequence

1. **Foundation** – Users, roles, profiles
2. **Competency layer** – Course units + self-declared grades + status
3. **Matching** – Help requests, filtering, ranking, accept/decline
4. **Sessions** – Create and complete session records
5. **Rating & promotion** – Scores, averages, Provisional → Verified rules

This order delivers a working end-to-end loop as early as possible.
