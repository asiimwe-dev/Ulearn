### Step 1: Fork and Clone

```bash
# 1. Fork the repository on GitHub
# (Click "Fork" on the Ulearn repository)

# 2. Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Ulearn.git
cd Ulearn

# 3. Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/asiimwe-dev/Ulearn.git
```

### Step 2: Create Feature Branch

```bash
# Always create a new branch from the latest main (or develop)
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name upstream/main

# Branch naming convention:
# feature/description   — New feature
# fix/description       — Bug fix
# docs/description      — Documentation only
# refactor/description  — Code refactoring
# test/description      — Test additions or improvements
```

### Step 3: Set Up Development Environment

#### Backend (FastAPI + PostgreSQL)

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate          # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start PostgreSQL (example with Podman/Docker)
podman run --name p2p-postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=admin \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=Ulearn \
  -p 5432:5432 -d postgres:latest

# Apply migrations and start the server
alembic upgrade head
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

> API documentation will be available at `http://localhost:8000/docs`

#### Frontend (Flutter)

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Verify setup
flutter doctor
flutter analyze   # Should show 0 issues
flutter test      # All tests should pass

# Run the app
flutter run
```

---

## Before You Start

### Check These First

1. **Browse Existing Issues**  
   Visit the project's GitHub Issues. Is your feature or bug already being worked on? Are there related discussions?

2. **Review the Project Vision**  
   Read the project README and research/proposal documents. Align your work with Ulearn's goals of reducing retake rates through verified peer tutoring.

3. **Understand the Architecture**  
   Read **[Architecture](./architecture.md)**  
   Familiarize yourself with the modular design, matching engine, multi-tier validation protocol, and data model before contributing:
   - Flutter frontend (mobile-first, low-bandwidth optimized)
   - FastAPI backend (RESTful matching & routing logic)
   - PostgreSQL (users, course units, competencies, session logs)
   - Review the [Project Structure](./project-structure.md) for repository layout and dependency direction.

4. **Discuss Major Changes**  
   For significant features or architectural changes, open an issue first and get feedback before implementing. This prevents wasted effort.

## Development Workflow

### Step 1: Make Changes

- Keep changes focused on one concern
- Follow the code standards below
- Write clear, maintainable code with proper documentation

### Step 2: Test Locally

**Backend**

```bash
pytest
# or specific tests
pytest tests/test_matching.py
```

**Frontend**

```bash
flutter analyze
flutter test
flutter test test/modules/matching/   # module-specific
flutter run                           # on emulator/device
```

### Step 3: Commit Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add competency verification endpoint

- Validates minimum B+ grade for tutor eligibility
- Integrates with Course_Units and Competencies tables
- Adds unit tests for boundary grades"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### Step 4: Create Pull Request

- Open a PR from your branch to the upstream `main` (or `develop`) branch
- Fill out the PR template completely
- Link related issues
- Request reviewers

---

## Pull Request Process

### PR Requirements

Every PR must include:

1. **Clear Title** — Starts with a conventional commit prefix
   - `feat: Add session rating feedback loop`
   - `fix: Resolve matching algorithm race condition`
   - `docs: Update tutor validation documentation`
   - `refactor: Simplify competency gate logic`

2. **Detailed Description** — What, Why, How

   ```markdown
   ## What

   Added multi-tier tutor validation (academic grade + portfolio + probationary ratings)

   ## Why

   Ensures academic integrity of the peer tutoring network

   ## How

   - Integrated transcript grade check (minimum B+)
   - Added optional GitHub/portfolio verification
   - Implemented provisional → verified status transition based on ratings

   ## Related Issues

   Fixes #42
   ```

3. **Tests**
   - New features: ≥ 80% coverage of changed code
   - Bug fixes: Include a test that reproduces the bug
   - Refactoring: No coverage loss

4. **Documentation**
   - User-facing changes → update README
   - API changes → update code comments / OpenAPI docs
   - Architecture changes → update relevant design docs

5. **No Conflicts** — Keep your branch up to date
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   git push -f origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### PR Review Checklist

Reviewers look for:

- Correctness — Does it work? Are edge cases handled?
- Design — Does it follow the modular architecture?
- Tests — Are critical paths covered?
- Performance — Any obvious inefficiencies (especially matching latency)?
- Maintainability — Is the code easy to understand?
- Documentation — Is the change explained?

### Merging

- All tests pass
- All feedback addressed
- Approved by at least one maintainer
- No merge conflicts
- Prefer squash-and-merge for clean history

---

## Code Standards

### File Organization (Dart / Flutter)

```dart
// 1. Imports (grouped and alphabetically ordered)
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';

// 2. Constants
const int MAX_TOPIC_LENGTH = 120;

// 3. Main class / widget
class MatchingRequestCard extends ConsumerWidget {
  // ...
}

// 4. Private helpers
class _RatingBadge {
  // ...
}
```

### Naming Conventions

| Element        | Convention       | Example                           |
| -------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Classes        | PascalCase       | `TutorProfile`, `SessionLog`      |
| Methods        | camelCase        | `matchTutor()`, `validateGrade()` |
| Variables      | camelCase        | `unitCode`, `averageRating`       |
| Constants      | UPPER_SNAKE_CASE | `MIN_GRADE`, `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`    |
| Private        | Leading `_`      | `_internalState`, `_validate()`   |
| Files          | snake_case       | `tutor_profile.dart`              |
| Python modules | snake_case       | `matching_engine.py`              |

### Code Style Highlights

- Prefer strong typing; avoid `dynamic` / untyped variables
- Use specific exception handling rather than bare `except`
- Prefer `const` constructors in Flutter where possible
- Document public APIs with clear doc comments that explain **why**, not just what
- Keep functions focused and reasonably short

### Comments

```dart
/// Validates that a student has achieved at least a B+ in the target course unit.
///
/// This is the hard gate of the multi-tier tutor validation protocol.
/// Students who do not meet the grade threshold cannot register as tutors
/// for that unit.
bool hasMinimumGrade(String unitId, String grade) {
  // ...
}
```

## Commit Message Guidelines

### Format

```
<type>: <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat:` — New feature
- `fix:` — Bug fix
- `docs:` — Documentation only
- `style:` — Formatting, whitespace, etc.
- `refactor:` — Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf:` — Performance improvement
- `test:` — Adding or correcting tests
- `chore:` — Build process or auxiliary tool changes

### Subject

- Start with lowercase (unless proper noun)
- Maximum ~50 characters
- Imperative mood (“add” not “added” or “adds”)
- No trailing period

### Example

```
feat: implement provisional tutor rating gate

Newly verified tutors start with a Provisional badge. After a
configurable number of sessions with average rating above the
threshold they are promoted to Verified Tutor status.

Ratings below the threshold automatically reduce matching priority.

Fixes #57
```

---

## Testing Requirements

### Coverage Targets

- New features: ≥ 80% coverage of the changed code
- Bug fixes: Must include a reproducing test case
- Refactoring: No reduction in existing coverage

### Writing Good Tests

- Use clear, descriptive test names that state the expected behavior
- Cover edge cases and boundary values (especially grade thresholds, rating cut-offs, and matching constraints)
- Mock external dependencies (university SSO, GitHub API, etc.)
- Prefer focused unit tests for domain logic; integration tests for the matching engine and session flow

### Running Tests

```bash
# Backend
pytest
pytest --cov=app

# Frontend
flutter test
flutter test --coverage
flutter test --name="matching"
```

---

## Documentation Standards

- Use clear hierarchical headings
- Include a table of contents for longer documents
- Provide concrete code examples for non-obvious behavior
- Link related files with relative Markdown links
- Keep lines reasonably short for readability
- Document public APIs thoroughly (parameters, return values, exceptions, side effects)

---

## Reporting Issues

### Bug Report Template

```markdown
## Description

Brief, clear description of the bug.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. ...
2. ...
3. Expected result vs actual result

## Environment

- Flutter version: ...

## Release & Versioning Policy

Ulearn follows Semantic Versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`):

- **MAJOR** — Incompatible API or architectural changes
- **MINOR** — New features in a backward-compatible manner
- **PATCH** — Backward-compatible bug fixes

### Branching Strategy

- `main` — Production-ready code
- `develop` — Integration branch (if used)
- `feature/*` — Individual features
- `hotfix/*` — Emergency fixes targeting `main`

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                              | Preferred Approach                          |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Committing directly to `main`        | Always work on a feature branch             |
| Mixing multiple concerns in one PR   | Keep PRs focused on a single change         |
| Missing tests for new logic          | Add tests before (or with) the PR           |
| Ignoring `flutter analyze` / linters | Run analysis before committing              |
| Very large PRs (1000+ LOC)           | Split into smaller, reviewable PRs          |
| Vague commit messages                | Use conventional commits with clear subject |
| Leaving merge conflicts unresolved   | Rebase regularly on the target branch       |
