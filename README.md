# Ulearn

**A Peer-to-Peer Academic Support Network**

> Dismantling the "attend lectures and fight for your life" model.  
> Ulearn matches struggling university students with verified peer tutors for focused, stigma-free micro-interventions — reducing retake rates and academic drop-off.

## Overview

Ulearn is a localized, dynamic platform designed for Ugandan (and East African) universities. It connects students who need help on hyper-specific topics with peer tutors who have proven competency in those exact areas.

The platform operates on a **B2B / incentive-based model** backed by institutions or corporate sponsors. Students receive frictionless academic support; tutors earn verified Teaching Assistant certificates and leadership credits.

## Core Features

| Feature                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Targeted Matching Engine**       | Connects a student's specific topic request (e.g. _"Matrix Transformations"_ or _"Database Normalization"_) with a peer tutor who has verified competency in that exact area.    |
| **Multi-Tiered Validation Engine** | Ensures academic integrity through: (1) transcript grade verification (minimum B+ / A), (2) optional external portfolio proof, and (3) mandatory post-session community ratings. |
| **Incentivization Tracking**       | Automatically logs tutoring hours and generates verified Teaching Assistant certificates + leadership credits for peer tutors.                                                   |
| **Frictionless Scheduling**        | In-app coordination optimized for mobile-first, low-bandwidth environments.                                                                                                      |

## System Architecture

Ulearn is built as a modular, high-performance system designed for eventual integration with institutional Learning Management Systems (LMS).

| Layer        | Technology       | Purpose                                                                    |
| ------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend** | Flutter          | Cross-platform mobile app optimized for low-bandwidth use                  |
| **Backend**  | FastAPI (Python) | Low-latency RESTful API for routing, matching logic & session management   |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL       | Relational storage for users, course units, competencies, and session logs |

## Local Development Setup

### 1. Database (Podman or Docker)

```bash
podman run --name p2p-postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=admin \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=Ulearn \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  -d postgres:latest
```

### 2. Backend (FastAPI)

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate          # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Apply migrations and start the server

## Regulatory Compliance

Ulearn is engineered for institutional deployment and adheres to:

- **Uganda Data Protection and Privacy Act, 2019 (DPPA)** — Explicit consent, secure storage, and registration requirements for handling sensitive academic data (transcripts & grades)
- **Electronic Transactions Act, 2011** — Intermediary liability protections
- **Institutional IT Policies** — Network security compliance when querying student portals or integrating SSO

---

## Pilot Implementation Roadmap

The project is structured for a focused deployment cycle:

1. **Phase 1 – Pre-Pilot**  
   Legal & institutional alignment, faculty buy-in, and initial tutor vetting (10–20 tutors)

2. **Phase 2 – Closed Beta ("Sandbox")**  
   Launch to a single high-failure-rate course unit (e.g. Computer Science – Database Programming)

3. **Phase 3 – Controlled Rollout**  
   Expand to 3–5 courses across different faculties

4. **Phase 4 – Post-Pilot Evaluation**  
   Aggregate session logs, tutor ratings, and impact on continuous assessment scores for official adoption discussions
